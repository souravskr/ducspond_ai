# **Neural Networking with Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset**

[SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) is a popular real-world image dataset which shares some similarities with [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. It requires minimal data pre-processing and formatting. In this dataset, all the images are **RGB** and in fixed shape of **32-by-32 pixels**. The dataset consists of **73,257 and 26,032 digits with total 10 classes** for training and testing respectively. 


## Files:

* **SVHN_CNN_64*2.ipynb** : with convolution neural network
* **los_acc.jpg** : in-sample and out of sample accuracy with loss
* **prediction.png** : predictions based on the testing data
* **SVHN_CNN.h5** : we saved our model
* **logs.zip** : logs generated by tensorboard for analyzing the model


## Findings:

* **We have evaluated our model with testing data and plotted several images with their predictions with percentage (out of 100) as follows:**

* **We also have plotted some graphs of in-sample and out of sample accuracy with loss based on the epoch value as follows:**
